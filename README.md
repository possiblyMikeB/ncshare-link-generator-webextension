# NCShare Link Generator WebExtension

A browser extension to help you generate [nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/)
links directly from GitHub which work with NCShare's container-manager service.

[Install Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nbgitpuller-link-generator/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)

## What does this do?

On the GitHub page for files, folders and repositories, it adds an
'NCShare' button.

On clicking this, you can enter the name of a [nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/) 
enabled container image and the application you want to use to open this file, folder or repository. Then you
can just copy the URL, and share it with your students! (or open it directly to test.)

The container image name and application you choose are remembered, so
you do not need to enter it over and over again.
